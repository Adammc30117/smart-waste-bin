# --- Weight Sensor Script (weight_sensor.py) ---
# This script reads weight values from the DFRobot HX711 I2C load cell module and logs them into a MySQL database.

# - Python driver library: https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_HX711_I2C
#
# Much of the setup logic (like `begin()`, `set_calibration()`, `peel()`, and `read_weight(n)`) is taken from the DFRobot sample Python script.
# The script below follows the same pattern shown in the tutorial with small adjustments to insert the weight data into a MySQL database.

# Authored and adapted by Adam McLoughlin for the Smart Waste Bin Monitoring System.

# --- Add DFRobot HX711 I2C library path ---
# This path is where the Python driver from DFRobot is located on the Raspberry Pi.
# It allows the script to import and use the `DFRobot_HX711_I2C` class.
